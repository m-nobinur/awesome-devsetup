# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Possible values for `animation`
# `Ease`
# `EaseOut`
# `EaseOutSine`
# `EaseOutQuad`
# `EaseOutCubic`
# `EaseOutQuart`
# `EaseOutQuint`
# `EaseOutExpo`
# `EaseOutCirc`
# `Linear`
#
# To completely disable the visual bell, set its duration to 0.

# Mouse bindings
#
# Currently doesn't support modifiers. Both the `mouse` and `action` fields must
# be specified.
#
# Values for `mouse`:
# - Middle
# - Left
# - Right
# - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# Values for `action`:
# - Paste
# - PasteSelection
# - Copy (TODO)
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double
  # or triple click.
  double_click: { threshold: 300 }
  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  hide_when_typing: true

  # url:
    # URL launcher
    #
    # This program is executed when clicking on a text which is recognized as a URL.
    # The URL is always added to the command as the last parameter.
    #  launcher: open
    #args: []

    # URL modifiers
    #
    # These are the modifiers that need to be held down for opening URLs when clicking
    # on them. The available modifiers are documented in the key binding section.
    # modifiers: Command
  

selection:
  semantic_escape_chars: ",│`|:\"' ()[]{}<>"

  # When set to `true`, selected text will be copied to both the primary and
  # the selection clipboard. Otherwise, it will only be copied to the selection
  # clipboard.
  save_to_clipboard: true

cursor:
  # Cursor style
  #
  # Values for 'style':
  #   - ▇ Block
  #   - _ Underline
  #   - | Beam
  style: 
    blinking: Always
  blink_interval: 500
  unfocused_hollow: false



# Shell
#
# You can set shell.program to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. /bin/zsh.
# Entries in shell.args are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#
# shell:
#   program: /bin/zsh
#   args:
#     - --login
#


# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# A list with all available `key` names can be found here:
# https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action`, `chars`, or `command` field must be present.
#   `action` must be one of `Paste`, `PasteSelection`, `Copy`, or `Quit`.
#   `chars` writes the specified string every time that binding is activated.
#     These should generally be escape sequences, but they can be configured to
#     send arbitrary strings of bytes.
#   `command` must be a map containing a `program` string, and `args` array of
#     strings. For example:
#     - { ... , command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] } }
key_bindings:
  - { key: N,        mods: Command, command: { program: "open", args: ["-nb", "io.alacritty"] } }
  - { key: V,        mods: Command, action: Paste                        }
  - { key: C,        mods: Command, action: Copy                         }
  - { key: Q,        mods: Command, action: Quit                         }
  - { key: Key0,     mods: Command, action: ResetFontSize                }
  - { key: Equals,   mods: Command, action: IncreaseFontSize             }
  - { key: Minus,    mods: Command, action: DecreaseFontSize             }
  - { key: K,        mods: Command, action: ClearHistory                 }
  - { key: Back,                    chars: "\x7f"                        }
  - { key: Delete,                  chars: "\x1b[3~"                     }
